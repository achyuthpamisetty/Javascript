//Object Destructuring
var employee = {
    firstName: 'Achyuth',
    lastName: 'Pamisetty',
    position: 'Developer',
    yearHired: 2023
};
//if you want the same name as object property
var{firstName,lastName,position} = employee      //---> Approach 1 for Object Destructuring

firstname
output: Achyuth

//---> Approach 2 for Object Destructuring

var{firstName,lastName,position, z='dummy'} = employee     //if z is not avaialble in employee obj then we can assign directly
z
output: dummy


//Array Destructuring
var arr = ['A','B','C']

var[first,second,third,fourth='D'] = arr    //Never give a number in the array destructuring as number is not allowed in variable

first
output: A

//Object.freeze
const person = {
    name: 'Achyuth'
};

person.name='Kumar'
person
output: 'kumar

//I want to create that objects are also not allowed to update'

Object.freeze(person);
person.name='pamisetty'

person
output: 'kumar'   //it doesn't update as we are using freeze & even you can't delete

delete person.name
output: false


//Date Object
new Date()
ouput: shows today date with time

//If you want to create your own data here is the syntax

//new Date(year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds,milliseconds)

//new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(86400000);             //JS starts the date from 1970 & if we pass he milliseconds of one day it shows jan 2 1970
output: Fri Jan 02 1970 10:00:00


//new Date(date string)
var d = new Date('october 13,2014 11:13:00');


-----> Examples <------

var d = new Date(1950,11,24)
d
output: shows the date

d.getFullYear()
output: 1950

d.getYear()
output: 50

d.getMonth()
output : 11    //Month start from zero to 11

d.getDate()
output: 24

d.getDay()    //day starts from 0 to 6 where 0 is sunday
output: 0


d.setYear('2023')
d
output: changed the year from 1950 to 2023
