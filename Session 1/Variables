//In console of the chrome

var -- > var is the keyword 
var name  -- > name is the variable

var name = 'Javascript'
name
Output --> javascript


Javascript is case sensitive
var Name = 'JS'
Name 
Outupt --> JS
name
Output -- > Javascript


Javascript is loosely-typed
In javascript the variable totally depends on the value

Ex:
var x = true
here x becomes boolean


var x = 10
now x becomes Number

//Variables cannot begin with Numbers, Keywords(true/false)

//We can start the variable with loadish

var _name ='Achyuth'

//We can also start with $ (JQuery start with $)

var $name = 'Pamisetty'


//Different Types of Variables:

var name = 'Achyuth'   --> String type variable
var age = 23  --> Number Type variable
var isAvailable = true -- > Boolean Type variable
var nullish = null


based on the value we can determine the datatype
